* So you want to go paperless?
The motivation is always clear but the execution almost always falls
short. At least, that has been my experience with trying to go
paperless in the past. I just couldn’t find anything that could beat
the simple, intuitive, and fast user experience of picking up a pen
and scribbling in a hard covered notebook.

Not only is paper easy to use for the person creating the material, it
is also easy to share, or keep secure. But, “insert all obvious
motivations for going paperless”, so I rolled my own solution that
addresses the above shortcomings.

The above is a snippet from a blog post I wrote on 2016-12-21, I have
since brought down the blog. The success and failings of my solution
back then is what made Org-Books.
